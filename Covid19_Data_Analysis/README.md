This project involved performing data analysis using real-time COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths]. I conducted various analyses to understand the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and the global population. Key analyses include the probability of death after contracting COVID-19, total cases versus population, countries with the highest infection and death rates, total deaths by country, global death statistics, vaccination rates, and other relevant insights. The goal was to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact on a global scale.
